-- Cumulative database upgrade script.
--
-- Contains one apply_change section per schema change; every new schema change is
-- APPENDED here as a new section. The current change number is stored in the
-- m_global_metadata table under the 'schemaChangeNumber' key - the same mechanism as
-- midPoint's native repository (postgres.sql / postgres-upgrade.sql). The table and the
-- apply_change procedure are created by config/sql/01_schema.sql.
--
-- Always re-run the WHOLE file against an existing database:
--
--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U integration_catalog -d integration_catalog -f config/sql/upgrade/upgrade.sql
--
-- It is safe to run this script repeatedly: apply_change(N, ...) executes only when the
-- stored change number is lower than N, so already-applied sections are skipped and only
-- the new ones take effect. The SQL inside apply_change does NOT have to be idempotent.
--
-- Use plain psql, NOT tools with their own transaction handling (pgAdmin): apply_change
-- COMMITs internally, which fails inside a wrapping transaction block. For the same
-- reason never put an explicit COMMIT inside a change. If a later statement depends on
-- an earlier one being committed (typically ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE followed by a use
-- of the new value), split them into two apply_change calls.
--
-- Fresh installations do not need this file: config/sql/01_schema.sql already creates
-- the schema at the current change number.

-- region change 2: connector.cloned_from

-- uses it to fold a same-version metadata edit back into the shared original connector.

-- Append new apply_change sections above this line. For every new change N (3 and higher):
--   1. add a "-- region change N: <name>" section here containing
--        call apply_change(N, $aa$
--        <any SQL, does not have to be idempotent>
--        $aa$);
--      ($aa$ dollar-quoting keeps inner $$ function bodies intact; the procedure
--      advances 'schemaChangeNumber' in m_global_metadata and commits by itself),
--   2. make the same change in config/sql/01_schema.sql and bump the number in the
--      "call apply_change" at the end of that script to N,
--   3. bump REQUIRED_VERSION in DatabaseSchemaVersionValidator to N.
